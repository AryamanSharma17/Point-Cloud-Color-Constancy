## Data
We provide the extended illumination labels of NYU-v2, DIODE, and ETH3D as well as the point cloud, the raw format image(for ETH3D), and the de-gamma sRGB image (for NYU-2 and DIODE). 

The data in the URL is enough for evaluating our results in the paper.

For the full depth information on the three open-source datasets, please refer to their website.




## Code

We are using the code for our extension works, the code will be public in Q3,2022.
